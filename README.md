DESCRIPTION:

The goal of this project is to design and simulate a 4-stage pipelined processor capable of executing basic instructions such as ADD,SUB and LOAD.this design demonstrate the core concept of pipelining,a fundamental technique used in modern processors to improve instruction throughput and oveall efficiency by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions.
In conclusion,this project provides a hands-on experience in implementing and understanding pipelined processor architecture.it highlights how pipelining improves processor performance,and howinteract with shared resources across different stages.this fundational design sets the stage for more advanced CPU designs involved hazard detection,forwarding,and branch prediction in future enhancements.
